# TODO

    - update the vector grad function. This returns a Matrix
    - Complete the matrix
    - make vector / matrix dependant on the *value* node instead of manually trying to figure out each of the values. This is actually a major flaw and will make the program faster!
    - Test vector and matrix class in test.cpp
    - run test.cpp, check if everything is working
    - Check every comment in every file; make sure if it is correct
    - Try to make everything organized / same format of code.
        - check if every declaration in every .hpp file is defined
        - print for vector
        - default constructor for all classes. like this: Vector () {...}
        - Check other things as well!
    - Make a shared / static library, place it in the lib folder
    - Test the shared / static library and update README
