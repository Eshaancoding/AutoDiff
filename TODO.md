# TODO

    - Make the ability to edit matrix and vector easily. For example:
        - ```b[0] = 6 // b is a vector```
        - ```a[0][0] = 3; // a is a matrix``` 
    - update the vector grad function. This returns a Matrix
    - Complete the matrix
    - Test vector and matrix class in test.cpp
    - Check every comment in every file; make sure if it is correct
    - Try to make everything organized / same format of code.
    - Make a shared / static library, place it in the lib folder
    - Test the shared / static library and update README
